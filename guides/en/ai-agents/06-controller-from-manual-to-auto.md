# From Manual Control to Automation

Manual-first execution establishes safety.

But no system should remain manual forever.

The real challenge is not *how* to automate,
but **when automation becomes justified**.

In BookiAI, automation is treated as
a **privilege earned by evidence**, not a default capability.

---

## Automation is a policy decision

Automation is often framed as a technical milestone.

In reality, it is a **policy decision**.

Allowing the Controller to execute automatically means:
- The system accepts responsibility for outcomes
- Human authorization is bypassed
- Errors become system-owned, not user-owned

This requires a higher standard
than “it usually works”.

---

## Preconditions for automation

Before any action can transition
from manual to automatic execution,
several conditions must be satisfied.

### 1. Stable assurance outcomes

The assurance pipeline must demonstrate:
- High pass rates over time
- Low ambiguity classifications
- Predictable failure reasons

Unstable or fluctuating review outcomes
are a signal to remain manual.

---

### 2. Low-risk, well-scoped actions

Automation begins with actions that are:
- Reversible
- Narrow in scope
- Low financial and regulatory impact

High-impact actions require
much stronger evidence before automation.

---

### 3. Consistent human alignment

Manual-first execution produces data:
- How often humans approve
- When humans override
- Why humans reject proposals

Automation is only justified
when system decisions align
with human decisions consistently.

---

### 4. Explicit rollback mechanisms

Automation without rollback is negligence.

Before automation:
- Reversal logic must exist
- Audit trails must be complete
- Recovery paths must be tested

If a system cannot undo an action safely,
it must not execute it automatically.

---

## Graduated automation levels

BookiAI does not switch from
manual to automatic execution abruptly.

Instead, the Controller evolves through levels:

- **Manual only**  
  All executions require confirmation

- **Conditional automation**  
  Auto-execute under strict conditions,
  otherwise require confirmation

- **Default automation**  
  Auto-execute with monitoring and rollback

Each level is explicit and reversible.

---

## Automation does not remove review

Even in automated modes:
- Generate still proposes
- Review still evaluates
- Assurance still applies

Automation only changes
**who authorizes execution**,
not how decisions are formed.

This prevents silent degradation.

---

## Why automation must remain revocable

Conditions change:
- Models evolve
- Data drifts
- Business rules update

Automation must always be:
- Observable
- Adjustable
- Revocable

A Controller that cannot
return to manual mode
is not governed.

## What comes next

With execution authority defined,
the final question becomes:
