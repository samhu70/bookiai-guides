## 3. Transactions list
- Rows show date, reference, description, amount, and status (paid/refunded).
- Filter by charge type (membership, add-on, refund) to focus on what matters.
- Actions: download invoice, view payment method, or open the Stripe portal (when available).

## 4. Download invoices
- Click the invoice icon to download the PDF receipt for that charge.
- “Manage in Stripe portal” opens Stripe for card updates or portal actions.
- Missing a past receipt? Use the support link in the header to request one.

## 4. Next steps
- Use [Accounts Transactions](./08-accounts-transactions.md) to see every ledger entry, including billing charges recorded as journal entries.
