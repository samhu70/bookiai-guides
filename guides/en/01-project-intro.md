# Guide 01 · Introducing BookiAI

## What BookiAI Is
BookiAI is a SaaS accounting platform with AI-native workflows. It combines multi-tenant bookkeeping, subscription-ready operations, and multimodal AI to automate invoice capture, ledger updates, and compliance for small businesses and finance teams.

## Why It Matters
- **Unified bookkeeping**: Ledger creation, journal entries, dashboards, and reports sit behind a single login for each tenant.
- **AI-first operations**: Multimodal models extract data from invoices/receipts and propose journal entries, reducing manual work.
- **Ready for revenue**: Stripe-based billing, wallet-ledger transparency, and quota controls are designed for fast monetization.
- **Global posture**: Multilingual UX, multi-currency ledgers, and country-specific compliance are built into the rollout.

## What You Get Today (Phase 1)
- **AI-native, double-entry ledgers**: Professional bookkeeping with automation and guidance for non-accountants.
- **Easy access**: Free signup plus Google login; more sign-in options will be added based on demand.
- **Unlimited ledgers**: Create as many ledgers as you need; manage them with clear quotas and billing.
- **Membership & add-ons**: Base membership plus extra ledger/storage purchases; wallet-style transparency on usage.
- **Payments with Stripe**: Secure checkout for subscriptions, add-ons, and wallet top-ups.
- **Multi-currency ready**: Built to support multiple currencies and automatic FX conversion (launching soon).
- **AI co-pilot**: Recommendations for account structures, journal drafts, and on-demand finance tips.
- **Multimodal capture**: Upload invoice or receipt images/PDFs; the assistant turns them into financial records.
- **Model choice**: Works with multiple AI providers to deliver best-available extraction and drafting.
- **Email to ledger**: Upcoming email ingestion so invoices sent to a mailbox land in your ledger pipeline.
- **Helpful guidance**: In-app tips and AI answers to keep you moving.

## Where We’re Heading
- **Payments & membership growth**: Keep Stripe as the payment rail; expand add-ons and downgrade/upgrade controls.
- **Multilingual experience**: Localized UI, notifications, and help center.
- **Mobile capture**: iOS/Android app or PWA for on-the-go uploads and approvals.
- **Open ecosystem**: OpenAPI access, bank-feed integrations, and deeper wallet/ledger visibility.
- **Compliance & reporting**: More country variants, richer dashboards, and specialized ledgers (e.g., mileage).
- **More ways to sign in**: Additional login providers and SSO as users request.
- **Self-service help**: AI-driven support flows and searchable guidance.

## What to Read Next
- `02-accounts-and-access.md` for signup/auth flows and tenant isolation basics.
- `06-ai-journal-entry.md` (once updated) for AI-powered journal drafting and review.
- Keep this intro handy when discussing scope or sequencing; it mirrors `docs/plan/1.system` for quick alignment.

Stay tuned for Guide 02, where we walk through sign-up and access flows to make this roadmap actionable in the product.
